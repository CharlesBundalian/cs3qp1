                    Hello! My name is Charles Daniel Wu Bundalian, I am a scholar of the Philippine Science High School. 
                    I was born as the eldest son of a family of five on February 28, 2008. I am an INTJ-T 5w6
                    who enjoys many things, from long talks about anything all the way to doing advanced chemistry 
                    for fun, you are more than welcome to message me on discord at CharlesDaniel#1201
                    I'd love to talk to you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been drawing for 2 years now 
                    with art as a side hobby, and as you can tell from my style, my favorite manga genre is 
                    Shoujo manga. I love romance and all the sweet filler in between, despite being terribly single 
                    and hopeless romantic... My favorite manga's include <i>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Is_Like_a_Cocktail">
                        Osake Wa Fuufu Ni Natte kara (Love is Love Is Like a Cocktail)</a>, 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otokonoko_Zuma">
                        Otokonoko Zuma (My Wife Is a Man)</a>, 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wotakoi:_Love_Is_Hard_for_Otaku">
                        Wotakoi: Love Is Hard for Otaku</a>, and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Love_You">
                        A.I. Love You</a>. 
                    </i>
                    Anything sweet lovey-dovey is all you need to get me hooked!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to web design I have no experience, so I apologize for my lack of proper coding skills
                    and ask for your patience and to bear with me (I'm running on pure stock knowledge from art class!). 
                    But I really do hope this website helps those who aspire to learn to draw manga, even in the 
                    smallest ways, please enjoy!
                    <br>
