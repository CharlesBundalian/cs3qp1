                <h1>Male Course</h1>
                <p>
                    Males often have more muscular physiques and broader anatomy, perfect for any shonen action genre
                    or male lead / love interest for a lovely shoujo romance story!
                    Here we'll learn the basic parts of male characters in manga, the anatomy of where they go,
                    and how to draw them! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this version of the course we will be covering the basic anatomy of the male head, just be sure to note that we 
                    wont be covering specifics like eyes or noses because like anatomy can be tweaked based on personal preference, 
                    that is what make your art style, it's the beauty of drawing 
                    manga!
